Diagnosis System Core Module
============================

This module implements the central diagnosis system that coordinates multiple AI models
to provide comprehensive medical diagnosis assistance. It follows a two-stage AI approach:
- A.I.(1): Primary analysis using ensemble of specialized medical models
- A.I.(2): Secondary analysis for follow-up questions and context refinement

The system integrates multiple open-source medical AI models including BioBERT,
Clinical BERT, Sentence Transformers, and specialized image analysis models.

Security Note: All models run locally without external API calls for privacy.
